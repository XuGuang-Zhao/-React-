We write some tests for component testing, which includes:
1. Login.test.js for login component. It is used to test whether the input box of the login page is correct and whether it can enter the user's email and password.And whether the submit button can be used normally.
2. Register.test.js for register component. It is used to test whether the input box on the registration page is correct, enabling users to enter the registration information such as the registered email address, name and password.
3. Search.jest.js for search component. The search component exists on the homepage and is used to search for housing information. Our test is mainly to see if it can render correctly.
